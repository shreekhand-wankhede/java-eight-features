In this repository, there are features described and coded 


The simplest lambda expression contains a single parameter and an expression:

parameter -> expression
To make a use of more than one parameter, add them in parentheses:

(parameter1, parameter2) -> expression
Expressions are limited. They have to immediately return a value, and they cannot contain variables, assignments or statements such as if or for. In order to do more complex operations, a code block can be used with curly braces. If the lambda expression needs to return a value, then the code block should have a return statement.
